== About Me
I received a B.S. degree in mathematics /summa cum laude/ from [http://english.pku.edu.cn/  Peking University (PKU)], in 2020. My undergraduate supervisor is [http://dsec.pku.edu.cn/~rli/ Prof. Ruo Li]. \n
My graduate supervisor is [http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~hou/ Prof. Thomas Yizhao Hou]. I also work with [http://stuart.caltech.edu/ Prof. Andrew Stuart] and [http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/ Prof. Animashree Anandkumar].

== Research
My research interests broadly lie in 
- Numerical Analysis   
- Partial Differential Equation
- Applied Probability

Actively looking for discussions and possible collaborations on interesting topics.
